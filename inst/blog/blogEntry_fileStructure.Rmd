title: "A meaningful file structure for the work with R and R packages"

Have you ever tried to find yourself around in the file structure of an already
existing project? To separate relevant from obsolete files in a “historically
grown” directory? To find out in which order existing scripts should be
conducted?

To make all this a bit easier, it helps to have a consistent file and folder
structure over all projects. This article addresses R users who have already
some experience with RStudio, R projects and R packages. The contents are of
special interest for those who work with R in a team, but can also be helpful
if you are the only one working on a project.

Here we present the structure we are using at INWT Statistics. Although it
refers to our work with R and RStudio, it can mostly be transferred to other
situations.


## A useful file structure

There is of course not the one and only best file structure. The following
figure shows our solution for a project's file structure:

![Fig. 1 -- A useful file structure](fileStructure.png)

The most important file is maybe the *.Rproj* file. You should always work in a
project when you’re working with R. This has the big advantage that all file
paths can be set relative to the project root directory. You can move the whole
project folder to another location and all paths in your code will still be
working! In addition, the *.Rproj* file contains useful preferences, e.g., if
the workspace should be saved when quitting RStudio or not.

The first folder is called *RScripts*. It contains all scripts written in R.
Typical examples are scripts for loading data, data preparation and data analysis.
It is recommended to number the scripts in the order they need to be executed
(or are typically executed).

All kind of data (original or edited data) lives in *data*. This includes
different file types (.Rdata, .xlsx, .cvs). If you want to save something you
computed, you also put it into this folder, maybe in a subfolder *results*. For
example, you may store the results from time-consuming model computations to use
them later in a model comparison report.

The *reports* folder contains the reports we create with
[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
Here again it can be useful to number the reports in a meaningful way.


## Where does the package live?

Virtually all of our projects include an R package. R packages have their own
specific file and folder structure, but where should these files be located?
There are two options: Either all package files are stored in an own folder
(called for example *package* as in fig. 1), or they are stored in the project’s
root directory (as in fig. 2).
Which way should be preferred depends a bit on the nature of the project.
In an analysis project (e.g., forecasting sales figures or computing a
[customer lifetime value](https://www.inwt-statistics.com/business-cases/customer-lifetime-value.html)),
the package files obtain their own package folder.
In projects where package development is the main task, the package lives in the
project root. This is the case for our
[INWTUtils package](https://github.com/INWT/INWTUtils).
(Putting the package files into the project root directory also provides the
advantage that the package can be installed directly from GitHub.)

## Work in a sandbox

In general, we install all R packages (our own packages and those from other
authors) on a network drive. Thus, everyone has access to the same versions of
the same packages. But if someone is working on one of our packages, it is not
desirable that every little change appears immediately on the network drive: It
could contain bugs and disrupt the colleagues’ work.

To solve this problem, we always work in a sandbox when making changes on a
package. More precisely, every time we build a new version of the package, it is
not written to the network drive, but into a particular folder you can see in
figure 1: *libLinux* resp. *libWin* (depending on the operating system). This
means that everything we try out remains in a self-contained environment without
causing any change outside.

How does RStudio know where to install the package when we build it? The
*.Rprofile* file is responsible for this task. It is always sourced when you
open R. Our *.Rprofile* changes the default installation directory in your R
project to *libLinux* resp. *libWin*. An example file can be seen [here](https://github.com/INWT/INWTUtils/blob/master/.Rprofile).

As soon as you are sure that your new package version is working well, you can
install it to the network drive and make it accessible to everyone.

In addition, the folders *libLinux* and *libWin* are a good place to install
packages you just want to try out  without filling the network drive with
garbage.

Even if you don't share a package directory on a network drive with you
colleagues, working in a sandbox can have advantages. You can for example work
on your own package without affecting the stable version in your user library.

  
## Just get started!

It’s still hard enough to orient yourself in a project where many people left
their mark on. But it becomes easier if the file structure is consistent and
well thought through. And this also forces you to work in such a way that the
colleagues after you don’t get lost in your files and folders.

If you don’t want to create and rename a lot of folders by hand, our [INWTUtils package](https://github.com/INWT/INWTUtils) can help you with that via the
function `createProjectSkeleton`.
