When you start a new project in R, you usually first need a particular file
strucure.
This includes certain folders, maybe the structure for an R package including
some basic tests, and several configuration files (e.g., a .gitignore, an
.Rprofile, ...). You could create this structure from scratch everytime, or copy it from an
existing project (followed by deleting all the unnecessary files from the old
project and realizing that you still did not catch the latest version of some
file). An easier way is to do it with the function `createProjectSkeleton`
from the `INWTUtils` package.

This furthermore enables working in a sandbox, i.e. you can play around without 
running into danger of destroying something outside our project (for details see
section 4).


## 1 Usage of `createProjectSkeleton`

`createProjectSkeleton` goes into action in the very beginning of a new project:
You still have nothing or maybe an existing empty folder and you need a complete
file structure as sketched above.
If you wish, you can add a package infrastructure and/or an .Rproject file.
The latter two can also be done separately (see sections 2 and 3).


### Calling `createProjectSkeleton` with default values

Using the function with just the default values will create the following
file structure in your present working directory (which would in this case be 
named *myfolder*):

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(INWTUtils)
createProjectSkeleton("../myfolder")
```

![Fig. 1: File structure created by `createProjectSkeleton()` with default values.](skeleton_01default.PNG)

The purposes of the folders are mostly obvious:

- *data*: all data, original or modified, e.g., .Rdata, .csv,
or .xlsx files.
- *libLinux* and *libWin* are folders where packages will be
  installed (see also section 4). They already contain a .gitignore file
  ignoring everything except itself.
- *reports* will contain R Markdown reports.
- *RScrips* is for your scripts. It already contains an example script to
  demonstrate a useful script structure.

The *.RProfile* is required for working in a sandbox (for details see section
4).
Finally the *myfolder.Rproj* file has been created. This R project file is
already filled with useful preferences, e.g. not saving and restoring the R
workspace, not saving the history and inserting spaces for tabs.


### Customizing `createProjectSkeleton`

The resulting file structure can be customized via the following arguments
for `createProjectSkeleton:`

- `dir:` Directory where the file structure should be created
- `pkgName:` If you specify a package name via this argument, a package with
  this name is created in your folder. It already contains the infrastructure
  to use the
  [testthat package](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf)
   and a first test for the code style of your package.
- `pkgOnToplevel:` Decide if your package lives in the project root or in a
  separate folder called *package*. The latter may lead to a better overview in
  your project root and is appropriate for projects whose main scope is not
  package development, e.g., a forecasting project. However if your project's
  purpose is package development, rather choose the argument default `TRUE`.
  The package infrastructure is created with `create` resp. `setup` from the
  [devtools package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/devtools.pdf).
- `rProject:` You may already have an R Project file and don't want to create a
  new one.
- `exampleScript:` If you don't want an example script in *RScripts*, set this
  argument to `FALSE`.

For example, the following function call would result in the file structure
shown in figure 2:

```{r, echo, eval = FALSE}
createProjectSkeleton(dir = "playWith",
                      pkgName = "playPkg",
                      pkgOnToplevel = TRUE, # Default; could be left out
                      rProject = FALSE,
                      exampleScript = FALSE)
```

![Fig. 2: Another file structure created by `createProjectSkeleton()`, this time including a package.](skeleton_02otherArgs.PNG)

In addition to the files from figure 1, you can see the package infrastructure
in the main directory:

- The folder *R* for R files containing the package functions
- A folder *tests* (already containing one test)
- An *.Rbuildignore*: This file specifies files to be ignored when building the
  package. It includes *.Rproj* files, *.Rproj.user* folders, the folders *libWin* and
  *libLinux* as well es *RScripts*.
- The *DESCRIPTION* file containing your package name and the packages 
  lintr (for the test) and INWTUtils as imports. All other information must be
  added by hand, e.g., your name.
- The *NAMSPACE* file.

Of course, the *RScripts* folder does not contain the example script,
and there is no *.Rproj* file.
  

## 2 Creating only the package with `createPackage`

`createPackage()` is generally called inside `createProjectSkeleton`.
It can also be called directly, for example if you want to add a package to an
existing project with an existing file structure. In addition to
`devtools::create` or `devtools::setup` it also provides a test for the code
style, the appropriate *.Rbuildignore* and imports in the *DESCRIPTION* file.


## 3 Creating only the R project with `createProject`
`createProject()` writes an *.Rproject* file with useful configurations. You can
specifiy if the project contains a package (logical argument `pkg`), if the
package lives in the project directory vs. a separate folder (logical argument
`pkgOnToplevel`), and, of course, the directory (argument `dir`).


## 4 Working in a sandbox

As mentioned above, `createProjectSkeleton` makes working in a sandbox possible.

### What does that mean?

It means that you can play around without affecting the outside world. For 
example: There may be a network drive where all packages for the whole team are
installed. If you want to add features to one of those packages, it should of
course not be built on the network drive during the developmen!
Or you just want to try out a new package (version) without affecting your
team's work.

By working with the structure created by `createProjectSkeleton`, all packages
you build or install are installed into *libWin* or *libLinux* (depending on
your operating system) by default. The otherwise default library stays
unaffected.


### How does that work?

R knows several library paths where it installs new packages. You can display
them via `.libPaths()`. The first path is the default path.

The *.Rprofile* file is always sourced first when you open R. The *.Rprofile*
created here simply contains a function adding the folder *libWin* resp.
*libLinux* to the first position of the lib path. As a result, R installs all
packages into this folder by default, even if the package you're installing is
already installed in another lib path.
